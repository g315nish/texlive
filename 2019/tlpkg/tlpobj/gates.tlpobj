shortdesc Support for writing modular and customisable code
longdesc The package provides the means of writing code in a modular
longdesc fashion: big macros or functions are divided into small chunks
longdesc (called gates) with names, which can be externally controlled
longdesc (e.g. they can be disabled, subjected to conditionals,
longdesc loops...) and/or augmented with new chunks. Thus complex code
longdesc may easily be customised without having to rewrite it, or even
longdesc understand its implementation: the behavior of existing gates
longdesc can be modified, and new ones can be added, without endangering
longdesc the whole design. This allows code to be hacked in ways the
longdesc original authors might have never envisioned. The gates package
longdesc is implemented independently for both TeX and Lua. The TeX
longdesc implementation, running in any current environment, requires
longdesc the texapi package, whereas the Lua version can be run with any
longdesc Lua interpreter, not just LuaTeX.
