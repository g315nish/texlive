shortdesc Create an external file from within a LaTeX document
longdesc LaTeX2e's filecontents and filecontents* environments enable a
longdesc LaTeX source file to generate external files as it runs through
longdesc LaTeX. However, there are two limitations of these
longdesc environments: they refuse to overwrite existing files, and they
longdesc can only be used in the preamble of a document. The
longdesc filecontents package removes these limitations, letting you
longdesc overwrite existing files and letting you use
longdesc filecontents/filecontents* anywhere. As of September 2019 the
longdesc author tells us: "This package is no longer necessary due to
longdesc its functionality having moved into recent LaTeX kernels. It's
longdesc probably better not to move the package to obsolete because
longdesc users may need it to rebuild old documents. Version 1.5
longdesc provides full functionality when run with an older kernel but
longdesc issues a warning message and disables itself when run with a
longdesc newer kernel."
