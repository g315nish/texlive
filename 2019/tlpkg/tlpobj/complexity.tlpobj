shortdesc Computational complexity class names
longdesc Complexity is a LaTeX package that defines commands to typeset
longdesc Computational Complexity Classes such as $\P$ and $\NP$ (as
longdesc well as hundreds of others). It also offers several options
longdesc including which font classes are typeset in and how many are
longdesc defined (all of them or just the basic, most commonly used
longdesc ones). The package has no dependencies other than the standard
longdesc ifthen package.
