shortdesc Draw dashed rules
longdesc The dashrule package makes it easy to draw a huge variety of
longdesc dashed rules (i.e., lines) in LaTeX. dashrule provides a
longdesc command, \hdashrule, which is a cross between LaTeX's \rule and
longdesc PostScript's setdash command. \hdashrule draws horizontally
longdesc dashed rules using the same syntax as \rule, but with an
longdesc additional, setdash-like parameter that specifies the pattern
longdesc of dash segments and the space between those segments. Because
longdesc dashrule's rules are constructed internally using \rule (as
longdesc opposed to, e.g., PostScript \specials) they are fully
longdesc compatible with every LaTeX back-end processor.
