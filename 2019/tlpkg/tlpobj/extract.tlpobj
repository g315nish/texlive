shortdesc Extract parts of a document and write to another document
longdesc The package provides the means to extract specific content from
longdesc a source document and write that to a target document. One
longdesc could, for instance, use this to extract all exercises from
longdesc lecture notes and generate an exercises book on the fly. The
longdesc package also provides an environment which writes its body
longdesc entirely to the target file. Another environment will write to
longdesc the target file, but will also execute the body. This allows to
longdesc share code (for instance, a preamble) between the source
longdesc document and the target file. Finally, the package provides an
longdesc interface to conditionally extract content. With a single
longdesc package option, one can specify exactly which commands (counted
longdesc from the start of the document) should be extracted and which
longdesc not. This might be useful for extracting specific slides from a
longdesc presentation and use them in a new file.
