shortdesc A BibTeX package to produce lists of authors' best papers
longdesc Many people preparing their resumes find the requirement
longdesc "please list five (or six, or ten) papers authored by you". The
longdesc same requirement is often stated for reports prepared by
longdesc professional teams. The creation of such lists may be a
longdesc cumbersome task. Even more difficult is it to support such
longdesc lists over the time, when new papers are added. The BibTeX
longdesc style bestpapers.bst is intended to facilitate this task. It is
longdesc based on the idea that it is easier to score than to sort: We
longdesc can assign a score to a paper and then let the computer select
longdesc the papers with highest scores. This work was commissioned by
longdesc the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, United States
longdesc Treasury. This package is in the public domain.
