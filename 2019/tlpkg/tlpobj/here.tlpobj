shortdesc Emulation of obsolete package for "here" floats
longdesc Provides the H option for floats in LaTeX to signify that the
longdesc environment is not really a float (and should therefore be
longdesc placed "here" and not float at all). The package emulates an
longdesc older package of the same name, which has long been suppressed
longdesc by its author. The job is done by nothing more than loading the
longdesc float package, which has long provided the option in an
longdesc acceptable framework.
