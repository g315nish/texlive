shortdesc Typeset exercises, problems, etc. and their answers
longdesc The package helps to typeset exercises or list of exercises
longdesc within any document. Exercises, questions and sub-questions are
longdesc automatically numbered. It is possible to put answers in the
longdesc same document, and display them immediatly, later in the
longdesc document or not to print answers at all. The layout of
longdesc exercises is fully customisable. It is possible to typeset long
longdesc problems, short exercises, questionnaires, etc. Usage of the
longdesc babel package is detected, but not fully supported yet (only
longdesc English and French are implemented).
