shortdesc LaTeX package for typesetting extensive games
longdesc The style is intended to have enough features to draw any
longdesc extensive game with relative ease. The facilities of PSTricks
longdesc are used for graphics. (An older version of the package, which
longdesc uses the LaTeX picture environment rather than PSTricks and
longdesc consequently has many fewer features is available on the
longdesc package home page.)
