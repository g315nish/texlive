shortdesc Exercises and solutions from the same source, into a book
longdesc This package provides macros to allow for embedding exercises
longdesc and solutions in the LaTeX source of an instructional text
longdesc (e.g., a book or a course text) while generating the following
longdesc separate documents: your original text that only contains the
longdesc exercises, and a solution book that contains only the solutions
longdesc to the exercises (optionally, the exercises themselves can also
longdesc be copied to the solution book). The exercise data are
longdesc generated when running LaTeX on your document; the first run
longdesc also writes the solutions to a secondary file that may be
longdesc included in a simple document harness, may be processed by
longdesc LaTeX, to generate a nice solution book. The code of the
longdesc package was derived (in large part) from fancyvrb.
