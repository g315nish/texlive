shortdesc Prevent files being \include-ed
longdesc The package defines an \excludeonly command, which is (in
longdesc effect) the opposite of \includeonly. If both \includeonly and
longdesc \excludeonly exist in a document, only files "allowed" by both
longdesc will be included. The package redefines the internal \@include
longdesc command, so it conflicts with packages that do the same.
longdesc Examples are the classes paper.cls and thesis.cls.
