shortdesc Automatic cover page creation for scientific papers
longdesc The package CoverPage was created to supplement scientific
longdesc papers with a cover page containing bibliographical
longdesc information, a copyright notice, and/or some logos of the
longdesc author's institution. The cover page is created (almost)
longdesc automatically; this is done by parsing BibTeX information
longdesc corresponding to the main document and reading a configuration
longdesc file in which the author can set information like the
longdesc affiliation he or she is associated with. The cover page
longdesc consists of header, body and footer; all three are macros which
longdesc can be redefined using \renewcommand, thus allowing easy
longdesc customization of the package. Additionally, it should be
longdesc stressed that the cover page layout is totally independent of
longdesc the main document and its page layout. This package requires
longdesc four other packages (keyval, url, textcomp, and verbatim), but
longdesc all of them are standard packages and should be part of every
longdesc LaTeX installation.
