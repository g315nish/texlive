shortdesc Typesetting reasoned calculations, also called calculational proofs
longdesc The calculation environment formats reasoned calculations, also
longdesc called calculational proofs. The notion of reasoned
longdesc calculations or calculational proofs was originally advocated
longdesc by Wim Feijen and Edsger Dijkstra. The package accepts options
longdesc fleqn and leqno (with the same effect as the LaTeX options
longdesc fleqn and leqno, or may inherit the options from the document
longdesc class). It allows steps and expressions to be numbered (by
longdesc LaTeX equation numbers, obeying the LaTeX \label command to
longdesc refer to these numbers), and a step doesn't take vertical space
longdesc if its hint is empty. An expression in a calculation can be
longdesc given a comment; it is placed at the side opposite to the
longdesc equation numbers. Calculations are allowed inside hints
longdesc although numbering and commenting is then disabled.
