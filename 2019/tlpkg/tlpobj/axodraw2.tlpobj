shortdesc Feynman diagrams in a LaTeX document
longdesc This package defines macros for drawing Feynman graphs in LaTeX
longdesc documents. It is an important update of the axodraw package,
longdesc but since it is not completely backwards compatible, we have
longdesc given the style file a changed name. Many new features have
longdesc been added, with new types of line, and much more flexibility
longdesc in their properties. In addition, it is now possible to use
longdesc axodraw2 with pdfLaTeX, as well as with the LaTeX-dvips method.
longdesc However with pdfLaTeX (and also LuaLaTeX and XeLaTeX), an
longdesc external program, axohelp, is used to perform the geometrical
longdesc calculations needed for the pdf code inserted in the output
longdesc file. The processing involves a run of pdfLaTeX, a run of
longdesc axohelp, and then another run of pdfLaTeX.
