shortdesc Arabic-Latin Modern Fixed extends TeX-Gyre Latin Modern Mono 10 Regular to full Arabic Unicode support
longdesc Arabic-Latin Modern Fixed is an extension of TeX-Gyre Latin
longdesc Modern Mono 10 Regular. Every glyph and OpenType feature of the
longdesc Latin Modern Mono has been retained, with minor improvements.
longdesc On the other hand, we have changed the vertical metrics of the
longdesc font. Although the Arabic script is designed to use the same
longdesc x-size as Latin Modern Mono, the former script needs greater
longdesc ascender and descender space. Every Arabic glyph in each
longdesc Unicode-code block is supported (up to Unicode 7.0): Arabic,
longdesc Arabic Supplement, Arabic Extended, Arabic Presentation-Forms
longdesc A, and Arabic Presentation-Forms B. There are two versions of
longdesc the font: otf and ttf. The ?penType version is for print
longdesc applications (and usually the default for TeX). The TrueType
longdesc version is for on-screen applications such as text editors.
longdesc Hinting in the ttf version is much better for on-screen, at
longdesc least on Microsoft Windows. The unique feature of Arabic-Latin
longdesc Modern is its treatment of vowels and diacritics. Each vowel
longdesc and diacritic (ALM Fixed contains a total of 68 such glyphs)
longdesc may now be edited horizontally within any text editor or
longdesc processor. The author believes this is the very first OpenType
longdesc Arabic font ever to have this capability. Editing complex
longdesc Arabic texts will now be much easier to input and to proofread.
