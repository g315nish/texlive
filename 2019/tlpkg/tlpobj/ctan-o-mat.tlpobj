shortdesc Upload or validate a package for CTAN
longdesc This program can be used to automate the upload of a package to
longdesc CTAN. The description of the package is contained in a
longdesc configuration file. The provided information is validated in
longdesc any case. If the validation succeeds and not only the
longdesc validation is requested, then the provided archive file will be
longdesc placed in the incoming area of the CTAN for further processing
longdesc by the CTAN team. In any case any finding during the validation
longdesc is reported at the end of the processing. Note that the
longdesc validation is the default and an official submission has to be
longdesc requested by an appropriate command line option. ctan-o-mat
longdesc requires an Internet connection to the CTAN server. Even the
longdesc validation retrieves the known attributes and the basic
longdesc constraints from the server.
