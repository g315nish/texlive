shortdesc User-friendly integration of Asymptote into LaTeX
longdesc The package is an unofficial alternative to the package
longdesc provided with the Asymptote distribution, for including
longdesc pictures within a LaTeX source file. While it does not
longdesc duplicate all the features of the official package, this
longdesc package is more user-friendly in several ways. Most notably,
longdesc Asymptote errors are repackaged as LaTeX errors, making
longdesc debugging less of a pain. It also has a more robust mechanism
longdesc for identifying unchanged pictures that need not be recompiled.
