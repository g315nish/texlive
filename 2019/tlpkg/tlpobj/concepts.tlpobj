shortdesc Keeping track of formal 'concepts' for a particular field
longdesc The package helps to keep track of formal 'concepts' for a
longdesc specific field or document. This is particularly useful for
longdesc scientific papers (for example, in physics, mathematics or
longdesc computer science), which may introduce several concepts (with
longdesc their own symbols). The package's commands allow the user to
longdesc define a concept (typically, near its first use), and will
longdesc ensure consistent use throughout the document. The package
longdesc depends on several other packages; while these are fairly
longdesc common packages, the user should check the package's README
longdesc file for the complete list.
