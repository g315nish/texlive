shortdesc Create exercise sheets and exams
longdesc The package provides the means to create exercises or questions
longdesc and their corresponding solutions. The questions may be divided
longdesc into classes and/or topics and may be printed selectively.
longdesc Meta-data to questions can be added and recovered. The
longdesc solutions may be printed where they are, or collected and
longdesc printed at a later point in the document all together,
longdesc section-wise or selectively by ID. The package provides the
longdesc means to selectively include questions from an external file,
longdesc and to control the style of headings of both questions and
longdesc solutions. As of May 2017, this package has been superseded by
longdesc its official successor xsim. exsheets itself is now considered
longdesc obsolete, but will stay alive, and will continue to receive
longdesc bugfix releases. However, new features will not be added any
longdesc more.
