shortdesc Provides a symbol set for describing relations between ordered pairs
longdesc Around 2008, researcher Byron Cook and several colleagues began
longdesc developing a new set of interrelated algorithms capable of
longdesc automatically reasoning about the behavior of computer programs
longdesc and other systems (such as biological systems, circuit designs,
longdesc etc). At the center of these algorithms were new ideas about
longdesc the relationships between structures expressable as
longdesc mathematical sets and relations. Using the language of
longdesc mathematics and logic, the researchers communicated these new
longdesc results to others in their community via published papers,
longdesc research talks, etc. Unfortunately, they found the symbols
longdesc already available for reasoning about relations lacking (in
longdesc contrast to sets, which have a long-ago developed and robust
longdesc symbol vocabulary). Early presentations were unnecessarily
longdesc cluttered. To more elegantly express these ideas around
longdesc relations, Cook recruited artist Tauba Auerbach to help develop
longdesc a set of symbols. This package provides an math symbol font for
longdesc describing relations between ordered pairs by using Metafont.
