shortdesc A programmable font test pattern generator
longdesc The package implements all the font testing commands of Knuth's
longdesc testfont.tex, but arranges that information necessary for each
longdesc command is supplied as arguments to that command, rather than
longdesc prompted for. This makes it possible to type all the tests in
longdesc one command line, and easy to input the package in a file and
longdesc to use the commands there. A few additional commands supporting
longdesc this last purpose are also made available.
