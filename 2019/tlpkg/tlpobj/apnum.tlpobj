shortdesc Arbitrary precision numbers implemented by TeX macros
longdesc The basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
longdesc division, power to an integer) are implemented by TeX macros in
longdesc this package. Operands may be numbers with arbitrary numbers of
longdesc digits; scientific notation is allowed. The expression scanner
longdesc is also provided. As of version 1.4 (December 2015) the
longdesc calculation of common functions (sqrt, exp, ln, sin, cos, tan,
longdesc asin, acos, atan, pi) with arbitrary precision in the result
longdesc has been added. Exhaustive documentation (including detailed
longdesc TeXnical documentation) is included. The macro includes many
longdesc optimizations and uses only TeX primitives (from classic TeX)
longdesc and \newcount macro.
