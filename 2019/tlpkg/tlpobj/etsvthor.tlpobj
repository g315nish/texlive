shortdesc Some useful abbreviations for members of e.t.s.v. Thor
longdesc "e.t.s.v. Thor" stands for "Elektrotechnische Studievereniging
longdesc Thor", a study association of Electrical Engeering at the
longdesc Eindhoven University of Technology. The author of the package
longdesc tells us: "Most of our committees use LaTeX to create meeting
longdesc notes or other formal documents within the association. When
longdesc you create a lot of these documents (which I do a lot, since I
longdesc am currently the candidate Secretary of the new board), some
longdesc abbreviations are extremely useful. I discovered that more
longdesc people from our association are interested in using these, so I
longdesc decided to put them in a package, so they can use it very
longdesc easily too."
